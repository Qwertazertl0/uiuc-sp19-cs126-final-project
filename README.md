# DOT: A Visual Experience
DOT is a final project by Maxwell Jong for CS 126 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, during the SP19 semester. The application is a small platformer with a focus on graphical elements, written in C++ using OpenFrameworks along with the SoLoud and Box2D libraries.

### Running DOT
Although the source code will compile, the resulting executable will not have the necessary game resources (graphics and audio) to operate correctly. Instead, the "dot_ver0" folder contains an already built version of DOT. Simply download the folder, and run DOT.exe to run the application.
